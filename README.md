# EDROD: Entropy Density Ratio Outlier Detection

This repo contains the official implementation fot the paper: [Robust Outlier Detection Method Based on Local Entropy and Global Density](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14960) by Kaituo Zhang, Wei Huang.

## How to Run the Code

### Dependencies

These codes need to run in a Python environment with specific package versions:

- scikit-learn 1.21
- Bumpy 1.23.5
- python 3.9.0

### Usage

We propose an outlier detection algorithm called EDROD. This method is capable of detecting various types, dimensions, and sizes of data.
